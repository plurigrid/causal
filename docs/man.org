In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~causal-man-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "C-o" #'causal-man-tmenu)
#+end_src

~causal-man-tmenu~ deviates from the default bindings of ~Man-mode-map~ as shown in the table below.

| Default Binding | Causal Binding | Command                               | Notes                                                   |

The following keybindings are recommended to support consistent behavior between ~Man-mode~ and ~causal-man-tmenu~.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "n" #'causal-lib-browse-forward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "p" #'causal-lib-browse-backward-paragraph)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "[" #'Man-previous-section)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "]" #'Man-next-section)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "j" #'next-line)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "k" #'previous-line)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "K" #'Man-kill)
  (keymap-set Man-mode-map "o" #'causal-man-occur-options)

** Man Usage
#+CINDEX: Man Usage

[[file:images/causal-man-screenshot.png]]

The Man page reader can be invoked via ~M-x man~, where the user is prompted for a search key. This search key is typically the name of a command that has an associated Man page. In the Man page window, pressing {{{kbd(C-o)}}} (or your binding of preference) will raise the menu ~causal-man-tmenu~.

The following sections are offered in the menu:

- Navigation :: Navigation commands with the document.
- Paragraph :: Navigation commands by paragraph.
- Section :: Navigation commands by section.
- Link :: Jump to other Man pages referenced in the current Man page.
- Page :: If the Man page reader is configured to display all manual pages for a given search key, navigation commands for multiple pages is provided.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Options Navigation
#+VINDEX: causal-man-occur-options

~causal-man-tmenu~ provides the menu item {{{kbd(o)}}} which runs the command ~causal-man-occur-options~. This will invoke ~occur~ with a regexp that searches for command line options (for example, "--foo", "-a") that can be navigated via the ~occur~ interface.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Man Settings
#+VINDEX: causal-man-settings-tmenu

By default, the Man page reader will /not/ display all manual pages for given search key. This can be changed in the Settings menu ~causal-man-settings-tmenu~ that can be invoked by pressing {{{kbd(\,)}}} in ~causal-man-tmenu~. 

Press ‘s’ and configure ~Man-switches~ to have the value "-a" to get all manual pages.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Man Unicode Symbol Support
By enabling “{{{kbd(u)}}} Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Causal Man will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus.
