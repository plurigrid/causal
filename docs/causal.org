Causal is a project to re-imagine the primary user interface for Emacs using keyboard-driven menus.

Emacs has many commands that are easy to forget if not used frequently. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offers discoverability and recognition. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient ([[info:transient]]) in Emacs core allows for building menus that are keyboard-driven instead. This appeals to users that prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

Causal organizes itself primarily around the different built-in modes Emacs provides. For each mode Causal supports, there is a bespoke designed library of Transient menus for that mode's command set.

Causal has no aims to be a mutually exclusive user interface. All existing user interfaces to commands (keybinding, mini-buffer prompt, mouse menus) are still available to the user.

To learn more about the motivations and design considerations for Causal and to see it at work, please watch the presentation [[https://emacsconf.org/2024/talks/causal/][“Re-imagining the Emacs User Experience with Causal Suite”]] from EmacsConf 2024.

* Introduction
#+CINDEX: Introduction
** Motivations
#+CINDEX: Motivations

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Goals

- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI toolkit for common Emacs commands.

- To allow for causal discovery and use of infrequently used Emacs commands.

- To be a frequently used interface for modes supported by Causal.


#+TEXINFO: @subheading Non-Goals

- Full coverage of all Emacs commands.

  Causal is not intended to be a power user tool nor is it intended to be a replacement for mouse-driven menus. Causal has no intent to exhaustively cover all modes available in Emacs with keyboard-driven menus.

- Strict adherence to Emacs command naming.

  While Causal is *mostly* in alignment with Emacs command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.

- No intention is made by Causal to help on-board users to the existing default bindings of a mode, nor  cater to users who already know them.

  That said, many existing default Emacs bindings are replicated in Causal. Such correspondence should be considered incidental.

- UX Stability (for now).

  Given that Causal is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

Editorially, all design decisions for Causal are ultimately the opinion of Charles Y. Choi.

** Transient Conventions
#+CINDEX: Transient Conventions

Causal is built using Transient menus and as such adopts its default behavior.

Each menu item has a key and a label. The key is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta {{{kbd(M-)}}} or control {{{kbd(C-)}}} key.

Transient supports nested menus. Exiting a menu can be done in two ways:

- {{{kbd(C-g)}}} (~transient-quit-one~) will exit the current sub-menu and return you back to its parent menu.

- {{{kbd(C-q)}}} (~transient-quit-all~) will exit you completely from a Transient menu stack.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the {{{kbd(?)}}} key or {{{kbd(C-h)}}} will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

When a Transient menu is raised, a command prefix argument ({{{kbd(C-u)}}}) and an optional argument can be entered before selecting a menu item. Menu items which particularly use a command prefix are annotated with the ✦ glyph. The command prefix can be cancelled with {{{kbd(C-g)}}}.

For Transient menus that offer setting different values, the following bindings will allow you save them:

- {{{kbd(C-x s)}}} (~transient-set~)

  Saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs session.

- {{{kbd(C-x C-s)}}} (~transient-save~)

  Saves the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs sessions.

- {{{kbd(C-x C-k)}}} (~transient-reset~)

  Clears the set and saved values of the active transient.

* Requirements
#+CINDEX: Requirements

Causal requires Emacs 29.1+, Transient 0.9.0+.

Certain menus require more installed software:

- Causal Dired: GNU Coreutils
- Causal Image: ImageMagick 6+

* Install
#+CINDEX: Install

Standard installation of the ~causal~ package is via [[https://melpa.org/#/causal][MELPA distribution]]. 

Configuration of a particular Causal user interface is performed per mode. Go to the *Install* section for a mode of interest below for guidance on its configuration.

** A Note on Package Dependencies
Causal requires a recent installation of Transient 0.9.0+ from either [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]]. If your version of Emacs is ≤ 30 but also includes Transient as a built-in package, you will need to set the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ to ~t~ to enable updating it via ~package.el~.  Set this variable and proceed with installing Causal.  Alternately invoking ~package-install~ with a prefix (~C-u~) will temporarily coerce the update of dependent built-in packages (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~causal~).

If you already have the latest version of Magit installed (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]), you can bypass the above instruction as Magit already includes the Transient package as a dependency.

** Upgrading to Causal 1.x to 2.x
If you have been using an earlier version 1.x of Causal, thank you. Please use the following guidance:

*** If you do not use ~use-package~ to configure Causal
Before installing Causal, you should update all of your existing Causal packages. This is most easily done via the package menu buffer ([[info:emacs#Package Menu]]) . After updating your packages, install the ~causal~ package.

Migrate your existing Causal packages from 1.x to 2.x by running the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x load-library causal
M-x causal-upgrade-base-to-version-2
#+END_SRC

Any Causal v1.x packages that have been superseded by this package will be uninstalled.

While not necessary, it is recommended to run ~M-x package-autoremove~ to purge any dangling dependent packages. Cautious readers can choose to audit any packages that are targeted to be removed.

*** If you have used ~use-package~ to configure Causal
For version 2.x going forward, I (Charles Choi) have decided to not offer any documented guidance on using ~use-package~ to configure Causal due my lack of expertise in using it. I leave it to more skilled readers to determine how to best use ~use-package~ ([[info:use-package#Top]]) for their configuration. Please also note that this is not a prohibition on using ~use-package~ with Causal. I am simply admitting that I don't know how to use it. 

That said, if you have used ~:ensure t~ to install a superseded package, you /must/ remove that configuration. After doing so, please follow the above instructions for installing ~causal~.

* UX Conventions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ux-conventions
:END:
#+CINDEX: UX Conventions

The Causal menus share common user experience (UX) conventions to facilitate usability. This section details this.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Common Menu Navigation

Causal organizes a mode's command set into a menu hierarchy. As the user descends down different menu levels, the user is given the option to dismiss the current menu or to dismiss completely all menu levels descended. Transient provides a standard convention for menu dismissal via the {{{kbd(C-g)}}} (~transient-quit-one~) and {{{kbd(C-q)}}} (~transient-quit-all~) commands.

Causal makes explicit the display of {{{kbd(C-g)}}} and {{{kbd(C-q)}}} at the bottom of its menus, which differs from the default behavior of Transient.
#+VINDEX: causal-lib-hide-navigation
Users who wish to have them hidden can set the customizable variable ~causal-lib-hide-navigation~ to a non-nil value. This can be changed from a Causal mode-specific settings menu.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Settings Menu

Most all Causal main menus support invoking a mode-specific settings menu via the binding {{{kbd(\,)}}}.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Unicode Symbol Support
#+VINDEX: causal-lib-use-unicode

The customizable variable named ~causal-lib-use-unicode~ which when non-nil will inform Causal menus to use Unicode symbol labels whenever supported. This can be changed from Causal mode-specific settings menu.

If ~causal-lib-use-unicode~ is set to ~t~, it is also recommended that the variable ~transient-align-variable-pitch~ also be set to ~t~.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Common Key Bindings

Listed below are keybindings which are common among Causal menus. 

- {{{kbd(J)}}} Jump to Bookmark…

  Causal places great emphasis on using Emacs Bookmarks to track different places of note. The binding {{{kbd(J)}}} is used in many main menus to support this.

- {{{kbd(\,)}}} Settings›

  Many modes have settings specific to them. The binding {{{kbd(\,)}}} is used in many main menus to support the configuration of mode-specific settings.

- {{{kbd(j)}}} Goto… (mode specific)

  Many modes provide a list of items. If a command exists that allows the user to jump to a specified item, the binding {{{kbd(j)}}} is mapped to it.

- {{{kbd(n)}}} Next, {{{kbd(p)}}} Previous

  For modes that provide a list of items, navigation to a next or previous item is bound to {{{kbd(n)}}} and {{{kbd(p)}}} respectively.

- {{{kbd([)}}} Next Section, {{{kbd(])}}} Previous Section

  For modes that organize items into sections, navigation to a next or previous section is bound to {{{kbd([)}}} and {{{kbd(])}}} respectively.


#+TEXINFO: @subheading Label Conventions

Causal annotates menu labels with the following conventions:

- ‘…’ :: If the label ends with an ellipsis, then the command will prompt the user for input.
- ‘›’ :: If the label ends with a right-pointing arrow, then the item will raise a sub-menu.
- ‘✦’ :: If the label ends with the glyph ✦ (BLACK FOUR POINTED STAR), then the command supports a prefix {{{kbd(C-u)}}}.
- ‘ⓘ’ :: If the label starts with the glyph ⓘ (CIRCLED LATIN SMALL LETTER I), then the command will invoke the Info reader.


#+TEXINFO: @subheading Menu Naming Conventions

To distinguish Transient menu (prefix) definitions from existing Emacs menu definitions using keymaps ([[info:elisp#Menu Keymaps][elisp#Menu Keymaps]]), Causal uses the naming suffix  ~-tmenu~. 

* Causal Modes
#+CINDEX: Causal Modes

Causal employs the convention of using the same keybinding to invoke a mode-specific main menu. This keybinding is re-used for each mode-specific keymap. The document recommends the default keybinding ~C-o~ for this purpose. Users who prefer a different binding are always free to use another.

Causal is organized into different libraries typically using the naming convention of ~causal-<mode name>~. Each library has within it a "main menu" which serves as the top level interface to access functions related to that mode. All main menus are auto-loaded, which means that it is not necessary to include a ~require~ call to load that library.

The following modes are supported by Causal:
