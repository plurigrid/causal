In your initialization file, bind the Transient ~causal-html-tmenu~ to your key binding of preference.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set html-mode-map "M-m" #'causal-html-tmenu)
#+end_src

A different binding ({{{kbd(M-m)}}}) is used as ~causal-html-tmenu~ is intended to work alongside with [[#editkit-install][Causal EditKit]].

It is convenient to also bind ~causal-html-tags-tmenu~ as well.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-set html-mode-map "C-c m" #'causal-html-tags-tmenu)
#+end_src

If HTML Tree-sitter support is enabled, use the keymap ~html-ts-mode-map~ in place of ~html-mode-map~.
