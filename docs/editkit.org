Causal EditKit provides a user interface for the numerous editing commands offered by Emacs. Its top-level library is ~causal-editkit~. As text editing is a core feature of Emacs, the menus provided here are intended to be made available in a global fashion for buffers that are intended to be edited.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-main-screenshot.png]]

Causal EditKit endeavors to surface the many different editing commands offered by Emacs via Transient menus. The main menu (~causal-editkit-main-tmenu~) both demonstrates and provides a reference to all EditKit menus. Motivated users can customize this menu to their taste.

#+CINDEX: EditKit Install

A reference menu (~causal-editkit-main-tmenu~) illustrating nearly all the different menus offered by Causal EditKit is provided. This menu can be used “as-is” with your binding of preference. For consistency with other Causal Packages, the binding {{{kbd(C-o)}}} is used in the example below. Other candidate bindings include {{{kbd(M-o)}}} and {{{kbd(F10)}}}. To facilitate default access to this menu, the configuration below sets this binding to be global which can be overridden per mode. This is /not/ mandatory and users are free to integrate Causal EditKit into their Emacs configuration however they see fit. 

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-global-set "C-o" #'causal-editkit-main-tmenu)
#+end_src

Also suggested is to globally bind the window and rectangle menus as shown below.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (keymap-global-set "C-c w" #'causal-editkit-windows-tmenu)
  (keymap-global-set "C-c r" #'causal-editkit-rectangle-tmenu)
#+end_src

For motivated users desiring a bespoke solution, it is recommended that they use Causal EditKit as a library of menus to build their own workflows.

** EditKit Usage
#+CINDEX: EditKit Usage

[[file:images/causal-editkit-main-screenshot.png]]

The main menu of Causal EditKit (~causal-editkit-main-tmenu~) is organized into the following sections:

- File :: Commands related to opening files or buffers are provided here.

- Edit :: Text editing commands are provided here.

  From this section, rectangle commands are made available via the “{{{kbd(e)}}} Edit›” → “{{{kbd(R)}}} Rectangle›” binding combination.

Causal EditKit has numerous menus to cover a variety of edit related commands.

*** Register commands
#+CINDEX: Registers
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-registers-tmenu

Support for register commands ([[info:emacs#Registers]]) is provided by the menu ~causal-editkit-registers-tmenu~. It is available via the menu item “{{{kbd(r)}}} Registers›” in the navigation row at the bottom of ~causal-editkit-main-tmenu~.

The menu ~causal-editkit-edit-tmenu~ contains commands and sub-menus related to editing text. 

[[file:images/causal-editkit-edit-screenshot.png]]

Depending on the buffer mode, text can be operated on with different granularity as words, sentences, paragraphs, balanced expressions, functions (defuns). The following sub-menus illustrate what operations can be done on the different text granularity.

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Mark› (causal-editkit-mark-tmenu)
#+CINDEX: Mark commands
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-mark-tmenu

Text can be marked with different granularity with this menu. Note that the menu item “{{{kbd(d)}}} Defun” is only supported for modes derived from ~prog-mode~.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-window-screenshot.png]]

Note that the section “Transpose” is only available if the package [[https://melpa.org/#/transpose-frame][transpose-frame]] is installed.

Users wishing more direct access to this menu can bind ~causal-editkit-windows-tmenu~ as shown in the [[#editkit-install][install section]].


#+TEXINFO: @subheading Window Deletion
#+CINDEX: Window deletion
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-window-delete-tmenu

This menu provides support for deleting windows. Note the commands apply to other windows, not the current one in focus.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-window-delete-screenshot.png]]

#+TEXINFO: @subheading Window Menu Unicode Symbol Support

If the variable ~causal-lib-use-unicode~ is set to ~t~, then Unicode symbols are used in the labels.

For more info on using Unicode symbols, please refer to [[#ux-conventions][UX Conventions]].

*** Search & Replace commands
#+CINDEX: Search & Replace commands
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-search-tmenu
Operations related to search and replace are captured by the menu ~causal-editkit-search-tmenu~. Note that this menu uses Transient prefix arguments (~--backward~ and ~--regexp~). This is because some commands have variants involving direction and whether to search using a regexp. Commands that support direction will by default operate forward of the current point if ~--backward~ is not enabled.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-search-screenshot.png]]

*** Open commands
#+CINDEX: Open commands

[[file:images/causal-editkit-emoji-symbols-screenshot.png]]

*** Tool commands
#+CINDEX: Tool commands
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-tools-tmenu
The menu ~causal-editkit-tools-tmenu~ holds an assorted collection of different tools/utilities provided by Emacs. Motivated users can use this Transient prefix as starting point to create a menu customized to their needs.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-tools-screenshot.png]]

*** Narrow/Widen Commands
#+CINDEX: Narrow/Widen Commands
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-narrow-tmenu
Support for narrowing and widening ([[info:emacs#Narrowing]]) a buffer is supported by the menu ~causal-editkit-narrow-tmenu~. Mode specific narrowing behavior is supported for Org and ~prog-mode~ derived buffers.

[[file:images/causal-editkit-narrow-screenshot.png]]

This menu can be modified ([[info:transient#Modifying Existing Transients]]) to support narrowing in other modes, particularly those that are packaged with Emacs. For example, if one wanted narrowing support for Markdown ([[https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/][markdown-mode]]), the following initialization code can be used.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (transient-append-suffix 'causal-editkit-narrow-tmenu '(0 0)
     ["Markdown"
      :if (lambda () (derived-mode-p 'markdown-mode))
      ("s" "Subtree" markdown-narrow-to-subtree)
      ("b" "Block" markdown-narrow-to-block)
      ("p" "Page" markdown-narrow-to-page)])
#+end_src

*** Macro
#+CINDEX: Macro commands
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-macro-tmenu
Commands for managing macros are provided for by the menu ~causal-editkit-macro-tmenu~. Note that macro creation commands are /not/ supported as they are tightly-bound to keybindings. 

[[file:images/causal-editkit-macro-screenshot.png]]

*** EditKit Settings
#+CINDEX: EditKit Settings
#+VINDEX: causal-editkit-settings-tmenu
Configuration of common editing-related settings are provided by the menu ~causal-editkit-settings-tmenu~. Most all settings are set via the ~customize-variable~ interface with the following exceptions for:

- “Auto-fill Mode (~auto-fill-mode~)”
- “Indent Tabs Mode (~indent-tabs-mode~)”
- “Fill Column (~set-fill-column~)”

Those commands will instead apply to the current buffer. The variables listed above can be more permanently set via the ~customize-variable~ command.
