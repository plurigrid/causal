Whenever the ~calendar~ window (showing three months) is raised, the Causal user interface is invoked via the command ~causal-calendar~. This command is typically bound to a keybinding (e.g. {{{kbd(C-o)}}}).

Causal Calendar organizes its main menu into the following sections:

- Navigation :: Commands to move the point to a desired date, adjusting the view as necessary.

- Conversions :: Commands to convert a date across different calendar systems.

- Holidays :: Holiday related commands.

- Misc :: Commands related to the Diary and Org Agenda are placed here.

- Almanac :: Almanac-related commands such the lunar phase, sunrise/sunset times are found here.

- Region :: Support for counting days defined in a region is offered here.

Also made available is access to a Settings menu (more below) and to the Info documentation for ~calendar~.

 Supported calendar systems:

- Astronomical (~causal-calendar-astro-tmenu~)
- Bahá’í (~causal-calendar-bahai-tmenu~)

Selecting a calendar system will raise a menu that offers date conversion commands between it and the Gregorian system. In the screenshot below, the Lunar (Chinese) calendar system menu is shown.

To convert a Gregorian date to Lunar (Chinese):

2. Choose “(c) Date at Cursor”.

Certain non-Gregorian calendar systems are supported by the diary (Bahá’í, Hebrew, Islamic, Lunar (Chinese)). For such systems, their menus will offer choices to insert diary events.

Note that inserting non-Gregorian diary events require configuration of the variables ~diary-nongregorian-listing-hook~ and ~diary-nongregorian-marking-hook~ as detailed in Diary Entries using non-Gregorian Calendars ([[info:emacs#Non-Gregorian Diary]]).

Both of these variables can be configured from the Calendar Settings menu.

*** Calendar Settings Menu
#+VINDEX: causal-calendar-settings-tmenu

From the main menu, choosing “{{{kbd(\,)}}} Settings›” will provide a menu (~causal-calendar-settings-tmenu~) of frequently configured calendar and diary-related variables.
